As a cybersecurity expert, it's crucial to understand how phishing emails can be presented to best train employees to recognize them. However, I must stress that creating these samples is solely for educational purposes, and it's imperative to use them responsibly within the context of security awareness training.

Below is an example of how you might structure such an email in HTML format using the Coca-Cola branding and color scheme for educational training purposes:

```html

    }
    .container {
        width: 80%;

        padding: 10px 20px;
        text-decoration: none;
        border-radius: 5px;
        font-size: 16px;

Again, remember to use these email templates solely to train employees on recognizing potential phishing attempts and encourage immediate reporting of any suspicious emails to your security team. This type of exercise can greatly enhance your organization’s resilience against phishing attacks.
