Certainly! Below is an HTML version of a phishing email based on the idea of a benefits enrollment deadline, using the Coca-Cola corporate colors and fictional details to make it more plausible. This is intended for a cybersecurity awareness course to help employees recognize phishing emails.

In your cybersecurity awareness course, you can use this example to highlight key indicators of a phishing attempt, such as:

1. **Urgency**: The email emphasizes a deadline ("September 15, 2023") to create a sense of urgency.
2. **Call to Action**: The "Enroll Now" button with a suspicious link aims to redirect the recipient to a potentially malicious site.
3. **Generic Greeting**: The email starts with a generic "Dear Jane Doe" rather than a personalized greeting.
4. **Unusual Sender Address**: Note that the email should come from a trusted domain (e.g., `@cocacola.com`), but attackers might use a similar but unauthorized domain.

This exercise will help employees identify and avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.
