This email includes:
1. Corporate colors and branding of Coca Cola.
2. A hypothetically urgent message about a new corporate policy on remote work.
3. Fictitious employee details.
4. A CTA (Call To Action) button directing to a supposed policy document.

For educational purposes, this example demonstrates the critical elements that make a phishing email look authentic. Employees should be trained to recognize such indicators to enhance their cybersecurity awareness.
