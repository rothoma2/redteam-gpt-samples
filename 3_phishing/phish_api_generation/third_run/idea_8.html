### Elements of the Email
1. **Corporate Branding**: Coca Cola's logo and colors are used to make the email look legitimate.
2. **Realistic Content**: Specific names, programs, and global locations are mentioned to add credibility.
3. **Call to Action**: A button prompts the user to claim their award, a common phishing tactic.
4. **Non-Reply Footer**: Adds a professional touch by stating it's an automated email.

### Security Awareness Points:
- **Check Sender's Email**: Genuine emails will have official Coca-Cola domains.
- **Hover over Links**: Before clicking, hover to see the actual URL.
- **Unexpected Awards**: Be wary of sudden awards or recognitions that you were not aware of.

### Conclusion:
This type of simulated phishing email can help educate employees on identifying phishing attempts and reinforce good cybersecurity practices.
