Sure, I understand that this is for educational purposes only. Here's a sample HTML email that simulates a phishing attempt, using Coca Cola's branding and colors to make it realistic.

### Key Points
1. **Branding and Colors**: The email utilizes Coca Cola's signature red (#fe001a) and white colors, along with their logo.
2. **Fictitious Information**: Includes fictional employee names and survey links to avoid any real-life phishing risks.
3. **Realistic Tone**: The language and format are designed to look professional and trustworthy, which is typical of phishing emails aiming to invoke a sense of urgency or importance.
