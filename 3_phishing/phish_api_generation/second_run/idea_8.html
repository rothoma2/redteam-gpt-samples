**Notes for the Awareness Course:**
1. **Realistic Details**: The email looks professional and trustworthy, incorporating the company name and a generic greeting.
2. **Call to Action**: The phishing email urges the recipient to download an attachment, mimicking a common tactic used by adversaries.
3. **URL**: Use a generic non-legitimate URL to demonstrate how malicious links might look. In actual phishing emails, URLs can lead to malicious sites or downloads.

Remember to emphasize to employees the importance of scrutinizing any unexpected emails, verifying the sender, and avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from untrusted sources.
